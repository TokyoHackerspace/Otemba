# Otemba

*Otemba*: Tomboy in Japanese.

Tokyo Hackerspace's very own Arduino clone.

Main purposes and characteristics:

* Really cheap (< JPY1000 all parts and PCB included, we could sell kits for profit, PCBs only for less profit)

* Great as introduction to soldering

* Great for the introduction to arduino class

* We would always have an arduino handy at the hackerspace

* It would fit nicely in the vending machine! We could sell it on the website. There could be a discount for members, or you could get just the PCB when you join so that you readily have a first project to do at the space (get the parts at akizuki and put it together).

* It would have the hackerspace logo and stuff, it could have a funky shape (a sushi ?).

* It would make a great final end of a crazy THS guided Akihabara tour. Could be a geek tourist kit. (Totti)
